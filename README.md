# NullPointerException - College Cram
Group project to pull updates from if we work separately from the group and also for mock up purposes

Proposal: College Cram
Overview:
As a team we plan to devise an online application of a study calendar in the style of a modern website that will provide a focus on customized calendars for daily life tasks, assignments, events, and any other miscellaneous tasks that have a need to be met.

Objectives:
Create two calendar views: monthly and weekly.
Create multiple color sections that store information per day.
Create the ability for user input to change the color of each section.
Create an ability to input needed information into each of the three boxes. Should also allow to happen every week indefinitely or until a certain point.
Create an area for users to sign up and log in.
Create a way for user information to be saved back to their unique user account.

Specifications:
We don’t want this application’s uses to be limited to simple calendar functionality, as there are many planner-like applications on the web. Therefore, we want to add multiple features that can make this useful for study plans, note taking, and overall organizing your daily tasks by enabling the use of filters based on keywords.

Milestones: 
When inputting tasks into the calendar, the application recommends commonly used phrases or frequently used user phrases to fill in the rest automatically.
Has a system to create user accounts and log in users that stores their own personal calendar information.
Accesses the web to create the dates for each month and provides a dynamic view depending on how many days of a month there is - not just good for one year
We will use a 3rd party API (undecided) to be able to handle tasks between the front end and back end so that users information can be stored, saved, and accessed later upon sign in
